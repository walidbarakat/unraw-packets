# unraw-packets
through my work on a private project i found my self in a situation where i need to manipulate literally a raw packets ( bytes from L2 ), it wasn't hard to implement it but i think it would be nice to make it an on-shelf library to be used any time and for many usage

this library written in C to support as many low level use cases as possible, as initial i provided the library in two files as header and source file.
